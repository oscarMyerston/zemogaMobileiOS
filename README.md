The VIP cycle
The Clean Swift architecture is using a VIP cycle to help you separate logic in your application. The VIP cycle consists of a ViewController, Interactor and a Presenter. All classes are responsible for some logic. The ViewController is responsible for the display logic, the Interactor is responsible for the business logic and the Presenter is responsible for the presentation logic. The image below describes the flow of the VIP cycle.
